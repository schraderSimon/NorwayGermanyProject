# A stochastic study of carbon emission reduction from electrification and interconnecting cable utilisation. The Norway and Germany case


How to run our code:
- In addition to the data available in the folder "data", the file "time_series_60min_singleindex.csv" needs to be downloaded from https://data.open-power-system-data.org/time_series/2020-10-06 and put in the folder "data" without modifying it further.
- All simulation tools are found in the folder "code". In order to recreate the data created (and existing in the "data" folder), running the python file "runall.py" is sufficient. Plots are automatically generated and saved in the folder "graphs". Tables are stored in the folder "tables". The file names are chosen such that the data should be recognizable, different files are created for different simulated years.
- Running the simulation using "runall.py" may take several hours on a regular personal computer.
